A jeweler wants to participate to an exhibition with sales abroad. Each jewel he
wants to take has a certain grammage of precious metal and a price. The rules of that
exhibition is that he must have a minimum amount of k pieces and a maximum of l,
respectively. He travels by air, so the maximum baggage allowance is G (usually 20 kg).
Help him choose the pieces for the exhibition that will bring a larger gain (assuming that
he will sell all exhibits), with respect of the constraints imposed by the airline and the
fairâ€™s organisers.
